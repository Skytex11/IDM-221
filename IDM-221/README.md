**Bean & Bloom Café**

A portfolio website seems interesting to do, but I'm afraid I don't have much stuff to populate my site with outside of my resume and possibly two projects. This term I want to build my project around an imaginary business. The site will be for a cafe that specializes in teas, coffees, and pastries

The site will serve as a virtual window into the café, allowing users to explore the menu, learn about the business, and discover what sets it apart. Key features will include:

1.  A full menu of teas, coffees, and pastries (prices included)
    
2.  Essential business information, like hours and location
    
3.  A contact form for inquiries about special events and catering
    

Additionally, one of my main goals is to incorporate an online ordering and pickup system. This feature is increasingly common in modern businesses, so I want to ensure it’s fully functional on the site.

By focusing on building this café website, I'll not only have a practical project that demonstrates my skills but also a decent portfolio piece. I’m taking a few more IDM classes this term, so by the end of it, I should have at least three more projects to add to my official portfolio.

The following are written out paragraph intended for the website:
